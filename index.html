               <h2><b>Accounting journal entries</b></h2>
               <br>
               <br>

                <p><h5>What are Accounting Journal Entries?</h5>
                <br>
                An accounting journal entry is the method used to enter an accounting transaction into the accounting records of a business. The accounting records are aggregated into the general ledger, or the journal entries may be recorded in a variety of sub-ledgers, which are later rolled up into the general ledger. This information is then used to construct financial statements as of the end of a reporting period.
            <br> <br>
            Whenever you create an accounting transaction, at least two accounts are always impacted, with a debit entry being recorded against one account and a credit entry against the other account.</p> <br>
            <br>

            <h2><b>Journal Entry Rules</b></h2><br>
            <br>
            <p>There must be a minimum of two line items in a journal entry, though there is no upper limit to the number of line items that can be included. A two-line journal entry is known as a simple journal entry, while one containing more line items is called a compound journal entry.
                <br>
            <br>
            The totals of the debits and credits for any transaction must always equal each other, so that an accounting transaction is always said to be "in balance." If a transaction were not in balance, then it would not be possible to create financial statements. Thus, the use of debits and credits in a two-column transaction recording format is the most essential of all controls over accounting accuracy. </p>
           
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2><b>Why Is Journalizing Important?</b></h2>
            <br>
            <br><p>The first and most important purpose of journalizing transactions is to keep your business’ finances accurate and well-organized. The journal records this data chronologically, through debits and credits, which makes the information clear to overview and accounting errors easy to spot.
                <br>
                <br>
                Secondly, these records are necessary for businesses to eventually create their financial statements, which is the essential goal of the accounting cycle. With these financial statements, auditors can analyze how transactions impact a business.

                <h2><b>Journalizing Transactions: A Step-By-Step Guide</b></h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Journalizing involves recording business transactions to keep an accounting record, using the double-entry accounting method. Here are the three steps to journalizing transactions in accounting:</p>
                <br>
                <br> <h4>1. CLASSIFY BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS BY ACCOUNT</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Take a look at each business transaction and classify it by the type of transaction. There will be two types of accounts involved in each transaction: one account will be debited and one account will be credited.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>2. DETERMINE THE ACCOUNT TYPE THAT’S INVOLVED</h4>
                <p>There are different types of accounts that can be included in a journal entry, and it’s important to identify the correct account type when using double-entry bookkeeping. The types of accounts normally used by self-employed workers include: asset, liability, expense and revenue. Here’s a full list of account types for your reference.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>3. APPLY THE FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING EQUATION TO THE TRANSACTION</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Remember the essential fact of the basic accounting equation: your financial transactions must always be balanced, with the sum of your debits always equal to the sum of your credits. So you’ll want to ensure that every time you debit one account, you credit the corresponding account.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>4. JOURNALIZE THE TRANSACTION</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>To complete the process, you’ll want to record the business transaction as a journal entry in the correct journal. Don’t forget to include the date of the transaction and a brief description of the financial event you’re recording.</p>
